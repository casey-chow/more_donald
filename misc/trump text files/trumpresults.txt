There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California! I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30.

Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” Trump. Remember when u see them No more Clintons or Bushes!  Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast! While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates.

Total fool @KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem. An all talk, no action dummy!
