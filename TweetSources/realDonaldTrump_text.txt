We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!`President Obama said "ISIL continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.`My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.`Boy is this guy @ShepNewsTeam tough on me. So totally biased. As a reporter, he should be ashamed of himself! #Trump2016`They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016`Thank you @JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. Should have been done long ago. #Trump2016`Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night. Thank you! Timing could not have been better! `@seanhannity Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! Sad.`@CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!`@CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room. Separate pieces—great ratings!`@CarlyFiorina Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. I didn’t say it, he did. Apology?`@CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize?`@CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov. Kasich to “let Jeb talk, give him a chance” because Kasich was constantly cutting in.`Happy Friday the 13th `Thank you Iowa!

So dishonest! `From 2% to 27% in Texas - quite a jump into first place!`Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.`Total fool @KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem. An all talk, no action dummy! `@WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal. `Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?`@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%`We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!`Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!`When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals.`The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.`@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.`Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.`I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30`All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was "so, so."`Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.`I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight.

Enjoy`@RobertGBeckel Please thank your brother for his nice words on television. Seems like a great guy and character! @CNN`One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of @FoxNews. Wrong facts - check Fox debate rankings, Trump #1. Dope!`Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. Probably done on purpose, but not good reporting!`@BillKristol has become a sad case. His magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong!`Will be on @oreillyfactor tonight.

Both solid & good guys. @FoxBusiness`Carson now admits his friend named "Bob," who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!`With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?`Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am #1, easily! Sad`Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.`A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!`The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!`Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame! `@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I "ran for president twice." Never ran, merely considered running!`Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, "he's my friend!" Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say "disloyal guy, no friend!"`Also, tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign, my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.`I will unveil my first campaign ads on @Morning_Joe at 6:30am tomorrow.

I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!`If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!`Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".`I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!`Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!`Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio READ THIS: "`Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win`Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time & money!`@thehill John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show.

Tell your writer Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president`No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!`Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words. All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd). Explain to Daniel Henninger!`#MakeAmericaGreatAgain `Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. Liberty Institute just suspended him!`Just left Virginia where I unveiled my healthcare and other plans for our great Veterans! They will be very happy! `@ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show, @TheHerd, on Monday (2:30pm EST).`The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me. They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them. Look forward to it!`Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya'`I told you so-@politico just lost it's top person.

Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!`I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac, which are total scams. Marco must address him as "SIR"!`The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.`Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS, CHINA, RUSSIA etc.`I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid, Carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate Gov.

Sad!`@Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa. @politico is a scam!`@CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers.
