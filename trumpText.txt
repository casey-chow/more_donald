Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016 Thank you @JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields.

Apology? .@CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize? .@CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov.

This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100% We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY! Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly! When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals. The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate. .@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later. Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door. I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30 All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was "so, so."
