Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook!

Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly! When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want \"smart\" trade deals. The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate. .@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later. Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

Leading New Hampshire 30 to 12. @FoxNews While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP. Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it! If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want \"smart\" trade deals. The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate. .@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later. Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

Leading New Hampshire 30 to 12. @FoxNews While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP. Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it! If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain! Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President! Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.

Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook!

A true piece about the standing ovations I got yesterday http://t.co/EplLsBWgBE The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly.

I will fix VA quickly. Via @fitsnews: "Donald Trump: John McCain Is \u2018A Loser'" http://t.co/sgiETvdUqi Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney? He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain! Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President! Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon. Statement on John McCain- http://t.co/Nh0rJPeUNl I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak. People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian). GREAT. The $10 billion (net worth) is AFTER all debt and liabilities. So simple to understand but @CNN & @CNNPolitics is just plain dumb! Ratings starved @CNN and @CNNPolitics does not cover me accurately.

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

A true piece about the standing ovations I got yesterday http://t.co/EplLsBWgBE The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly.

I will fix VA quickly. Via @fitsnews: "Donald Trump: John McCain Is \u2018A Loser'" http://t.co/sgiETvdUqi Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney? He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain! Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President! Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon. Statement on John McCain- http://t.co/Nh0rJPeUNl I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak. People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian). GREAT. The $10 billion (net worth) is AFTER all debt and liabilities. So simple to understand but @CNN & @CNNPolitics is just plain dumb! Ratings starved @CNN and @CNNPolitics does not cover me accurately.

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain! Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President! Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a \"lightweight\". I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! Jeb's new slogan - \"Jeb can fix it\". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word \"fix\" is not a good one to use in politics! Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8\" Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win \"@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway, for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President!!!!\" \"@Michael_0000: [First Vote News Video | Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President] - https://t.co/7c0VeVj5ko\"  Thanks Mike! \"@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner.

He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain! Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets! All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes! In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President! Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. I will be back soon.

Nothing personal, just business. Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. Icahn, Black, Zell-but nobody says they went bankrupt! People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. It's a very effective & commonly used business tool. Stop saying I went bankrupt. I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage-smart!
